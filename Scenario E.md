# RE: Next Steps for Application and Schedule of Classes

Hi Jake!

To complete your application, you must submit a pre-work project. You can view the step by step process in this link **[AND101|Prework](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/and101/prework)** and the details on how to submit it is already shown in the same link.

Regarding the schedule of the class, students are expected to commit 4-6 hours a week during the duration of the *10-week program*:

**- 2 hour synchronous class time**

**- 2-4 hrs asynchronous work time on projects**

You can view more details of the course in this link **[Intro to Android Development](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/and101/syllabus)**.

Looking forward to the completion of your application! Thank you and best regards.
