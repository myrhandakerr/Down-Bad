# RE: Withdrawal From Class

Hi Dennis!

This is regarding your status in the **TIP101 (Intro to Technical Interview Prep)**. We have already sent a confirmation email with regards to your removal *due to non-compliance of our course policy (missing coursework)*. 

Before we can drop a student from the course we *send them a message via email or slack asking them the reason why they were not able to submit the coursework*. Unfortunately, we haven't heard anything back from you which caused your withdrawal. Although we cannot put you back to the same class, you will still have **lifetime access** to the course material provided that you will use the github you used to sign up for us.

As much as we want you back in the class we have policies to which we all should adhere.

Best regards,
CodePath.org Team
