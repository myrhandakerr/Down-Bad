#  RE: Request to bump up to Advanced Track

Good day, **John**!

This is with regards to your application for the * Technical Interview Prep* program and request to bump up to the advanced track. Although we are greatly impressed with your background and credentials, unfortunately, upon assessment we can only admit you to the **Intermediate Track**.

The following are the prerequisites you need to meet to be able to qualify for the Advanced Track:

Students must have taken at least one basic programming course and an algorithms and data structures course. Students entering the program are expected to be able to:

- define and implement CS fundamentals including primitive data types, simple mathematical operations, conditionals, loops, and functions in either Java8 or Python programming language.
- perform basic operations on core data structures including creation, deletion, manipulation, traversal, and comparison.
      *Note: Core Data structures includes 1D and 2D Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, HashMaps, Heaps, and Trees.*
- develop a set of test cases and trace through a code snippet by hand.
- identify time complexity in Big O notation for code snippets with constant, linear, quadratic, or logorithmic runtime complexity

If you want to read more about our tracks, you can click the link below. The first few topics are similar, but the pace of the track depends greatly on the level of the course.

1. [Intermediate Track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip102/syllabus)
2. [Advanced track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip103/syllabus)


In this case, for now, you only qualify for the **Intermediate Track**. As you continue our program in the long run, we are looking forward to admitting you to the Advanced Track. Thank you and best wishes!Â
